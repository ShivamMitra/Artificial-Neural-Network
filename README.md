## About  
This repository showcases core implementations of neural network fundamentals:  
- A simple feed-forward neural network from scratch  
- Backpropagation for error propagation  
- Activation functions, cost/loss functions, optimisation steps  
- Use-case(s) on standard dataset(s) (e.g., classification/regression)  
The aim is to provide clear, educational code that helps you understand how ANNs work under the hood, and serve as a reusable base for more complex deep-learning workflows.

## What’s Included  
Here are the key items in the repo:  
- `neural_network.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook walking through building an ANN from scratch  
- `data/` — folder containing the dataset(s) used (or links to them)  
- `utils.py` — helper functions for network initialisation, forward/backward passes, etc.  
- `README.md` — this file  
- (Optional) `requirements.txt` — list of python dependencies  

## Getting Started  
Follow these steps to run and explore the project:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamMitra/Artificial-Neural-Network.git
   cd Artificial-Neural-Network

2. Set up a Python environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   Copy code
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   Copy code
   pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt doesn’t exist yet, you may install typical packages like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   Copy code
   jupyter notebook
Open neural_network.ipynb and follow the notebook flow.

## Usage
- Open the notebook and run each cell in sequence.
- Modify network architecture (number of layers, neurons per layer), learning rate, activation functions, etc., to experiment.
- Change the dataset (if provided) to test the network on different tasks.
- Use the code as a template or base for extending into deeper networks, convolutional neural networks, or other tasks.

## Dependencies
Here are typical Python packages used (you can specify versions):
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualisations)
- jupyter
(Optional) scikit-learn (for dataset loading / comparison)
